#### Sorting

![Sorted](./images/SortedEmployee.jpg)

Each column can be sorted in ascending or in descending order by clicking the arrow in the column header. The arrow indicates the current column being sorted and the direction of the arrow shows which direction the column is sorted (Down - Ascending, Up - Descending, Up & Down - Not Sorted).


#### Filtering


Each column can be filtered by clicking on the filter icon in the column header. A green colored filter icon indicates that the column currently has a filter applied to it. Clicking on the filter icon will bring up the filter menu.
